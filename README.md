# CSE111-Project

Course: CSE 111 - Database Systems
Term: Fall 2020
Authors: Ediel Lopez and Jonathan Alfaro Valdovinos
Purpose: Design and implement a tiered data management application consisting of an interface for interacting with
the user and a back-end database for storing and retrieving the data. The user should have the capability
to visualize the data in the database, add new data, delete, and update existing data. Extracting statistics
and reports from the database is a feature that you should also consider.
